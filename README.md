-> After setting the UV environment variables, you may still be unable to run the <virtual_env_name>/Scripts/activate.ps1 file because of the script execution policy
```
# 1. Run PowerShell as Administrator

# 2. Check the execution policy
# -> Youâ€™ll typically see one of the following: Restricted, RemoteSigned, or AllSigned. If it's set to Restricted, you may run into issues.
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# 3. Change the execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

# The execution policy is for system security, so if you want to revert it back to its original state after use, you can run the following command
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
```
